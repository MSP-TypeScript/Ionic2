Angular 2 is the next version of Google’s massively popular MV\* framework for building complex applications in the browser

 \(and beyond\).

Angular 2 comes with almost everything you need to build a complicated frontend web or mobile apps, from powerful templates to fast rendering, data management, HTTP services, form handling, and so much more.

In many ways, Angular 2 still felt like Angular, it was just based on new JavaScript standards and using best-practices developed in the years after the first Angular release. “Angular” had become a design pattern with multiple implementations.

Today, Ionic is the world's most popular cross-platform mobile development technology, powering fast growing startups to some of the biggest companies in the world.

Ionic 2 apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command line utility \(the “CLI”\), and use Cordova to build and deploy as a native app.

For those building native apps for iOS and Android \(most of you!\), each platform has certain features and installation requirements before you can get the most out of your Ionic and Cordova development.
